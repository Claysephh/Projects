# Projects
Projects completed with a team of at least 4 working on different elements in unison.

Vending Machine - An app we created strictly living inside Visual Studio. You can select items, enter currency and it is all logged and audited. Open file and 
run program in VS to be prompted.

TEnmo - Console based app used to send "TE bucks" between users. Data is logged in SQL and Postman.

Winery Wanderer - A Winery Finder, must have server running in VS and in VS code. Several languages used to pull data from a local API, we would have connected to
a larger API for more content but most of them charge money. Once website is running you can login as Admin, Owner and User that each have their own unique
experiences.
